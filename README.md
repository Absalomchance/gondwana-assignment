
Welcome! This repository contains a coding assignment completed as part of a job application process. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in building a full-stack solution using PHP and JavaScript.

##  Objective
- Develop a RESTful API using **PHP**
- Construct a simple **UI** to interact with the API
- Ensure compatibility with **GitHub Codespaces**
- Implement **quality checks** using **SonarCloud**

##  Project Structure
- **Backend:** PHP-based RESTful API that processes and transforms client payloads to match a remote API format and relays the response.
- **Frontend:** Interactive and minimal user interface that allows submission of form data and displays rate information in a user-friendly way.

##  Features
###  Backend
- Accepts a JSON payload:
  ```json
  {
    "Unit Name": "String",
    "Arrival": "dd/mm/yyyy",
    "Departure": "dd/mm/yyyy",
    "Occupants": 2,
    "Ages": [30, 5]
  }
Transforms and sends the payload to:
https://dev.gondwana-collection.com/Web-Store/Rates/Rates.php using POST.

Payload is mutated to:
json{
  "Unit Type ID": -2147483637,
  "Arrival": "yyyy-mm-dd",
  "Departure": "yyyy-mm-dd",
  "Guests": [
    { "Age Group": "Adult" },
    { "Age Group": "Child" }
  ]
}
Supports Unit Type IDs: -2147483637, -2147483456
Returns processed rate details back to the frontend.
üñ•Ô∏è Frontend
